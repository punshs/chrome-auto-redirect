# Chrome Auto-Redirect Extension

A Chrome extension for kiosk displays that automatically redirects back to the home page after navigation. Perfect for public displays, information kiosks, and digital signage.

## Features

- üè† Automatic home page detection
- ‚ö° Instant redirect after timeout
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable settings
- üñ•Ô∏è Kiosk mode support
- üéØ No popup interface - works silently in the background

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/punshs/chrome-auto-redirect.git
cd chrome-auto-redirect
```

2. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the extension folder

## Configuration

1. Right-click the extension icon and select "Options", or visit:
   `chrome://extensions/?options=<extension_id>`

2. Configure:
   - **Default URL** (optional): If set, always redirects to this URL. If not set, uses the first loaded page as home.
   - **Timeout** (seconds): How long to wait before redirecting back to home page after navigation.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open Chrome with your desired home page
2. The extension will automatically:
   - Set the current page as home (unless a default URL is configured)
   - Monitor for navigation to other pages
   - Redirect back to home after the set timeout

### Kiosk Mode

#### Windows
```batch
launch-kiosk.bat [initial-url]
```

#### Linux
```bash
./launch-kiosk.sh [initial-url]
```

The `initial-url` parameter is optional. If not provided, Chrome will open to `about:blank`.

### How it Works

1. When Chrome starts:
   - If a default URL is set in options, it becomes the home page
   - Otherwise, the first loaded page becomes the home page

2. During operation:
   - When user navigates to any other page, a timer starts
   - After the configured timeout, redirects back to home
   - Process repeats for any new navigation

## Exit Kiosk Mode

- Windows/Linux: Press `Alt+F4` or `Ctrl+Shift+W`
